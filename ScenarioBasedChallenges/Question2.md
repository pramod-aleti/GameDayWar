# Scenario: Implementing Zero Trust Architecture 

## Question: Your company is transitioning to a Zero Trust security model for its cloud infrastructure. Outline the key components of Zero Trust architecture and explain how you would implement this model. What challenges might you face, and how would you address them? 

## Answer
 
Zero Trust architecture is based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." Key components include:

Identity Verification: Ensure strong authentication and authorisation for all users and devices.
Least Privilege Access: Grant users the minimum access necessary for their roles.
Micro-Segmentation: Divide the network into smaller segments to limit lateral movement.
Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitor and analyse user activities and network traffic.
Data Encryption: Encrypt data both at rest and in transit.
To implement Zero Trust, start by identifying critical assets and users, then enforce strict access controls and continuous monitoring. Use multi-factor authentication and micro-segmentation to enhance security.

Challenges include potential resistance to change, complexity in implementation, and performance impacts. Address these by providing training, using phased implementation, and optimising network performance.

By following these steps, you can effectively transition to a Zero Trust security model and enhance your cloud infrastructure's security.
