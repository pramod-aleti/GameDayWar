# Scenario: Insider Threats in Cloud Services 

## Question: Consider a scenario where an insider threat has been detected within your cloud services. Describe the steps you would take to investigate and address this threat. What measures would you implement to prevent insider threats in the future? 

## Answer

To address an insider threat within cloud services, start by containing the threat and activating an incident response team. Collect and preserve relevant data, conduct forensic analysis, and interview involved personnel. Assess the damage and document findings.

Preventive measures include implementing strict access controls, regular monitoring and auditing, and employee training on security policies. Use behavioural analytics to detect anomalies, encrypt sensitive data, and develop an incident response plan. Conduct thorough background checks and enforce separation of duties to minimise risks. Avoid logging sensitive information directly and ensure secure storage of data.

By following these steps, you can effectively investigate and address insider threats while implementing measures to prevent future incidents.
